WebService-OnlineJudge

This is the README file for the WebService::OnlineJudge module. This
concerns only the installation procedure, so please refer to the POD
for usage (just type 'perldoc WebService::OnlineJudge' after the 
installation, or find it on search.cpan.org).

The WebService::OnlineJudge module is a pure Perl module that requires
WWW::Mechanize, but the installation should take care of that for you
in case you don't already have it. You don't need any special environment
in order to build this module - although you will need an Internet
connection to use it.

This is the first version of the module (0.01), so stay tuned for new
features and enhancements!
